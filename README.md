## An Angular Side-Project

With this side-project I will create an app which allows users to keep track of media (books, movies, etc) they have consumed (read, or watched, or...). Users will be able to rate media items, add items to a favorites list, sort by certain parameters, and perhaps other functionality as the project develops.

### Core Functionality

The primary functionality of this app will allow users to add media items to have a sort of diary of what they've read/seen, and then to rate these items. They will be able to create a favorites list by choosing favorite items from those entered.
